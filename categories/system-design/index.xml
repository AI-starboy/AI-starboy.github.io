      <description>Load balancer is another critical component in distributed system. it helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases. LB also tracks of the status of all the resources while distributing requests. If a server is not available to take new requests, or is not responding or has elevated error rate, the load balance will not pass on requests to that server.</description>

      <description>Why do we need URLs shortening? URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for long URLs. We call these shortened aliases &amp;ldquo;short links&amp;rdquo;. Users are redirected to the original URLs when they hit those short links. Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.
The shortened URL is nearly one-third of the size of the actual URL.</description>
