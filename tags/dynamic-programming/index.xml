      <description>Maximum Width Ramp üîó LC962
Given an array A of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which i &amp;lt; j and A[i] &amp;lt;= A[j]. The width of such a ramp is j - i.
Find the maximum width of a ramp in A. If one doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, return 0.
&amp;gt; Example 1: Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5] Output: 4 Explanation: The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.</description>

It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.</description>
